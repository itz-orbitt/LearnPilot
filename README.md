> Upload a chapter. Master it with AI.

**LearnPilot** is an **AI-powered learning platform** that transforms **textbook chapters into structured, interactive study experiences**.

Upload a textbook chapter as a PDF and LearnPilot turns it into:

- **Structured chapter topics**
- **Detailed study notes**
- **Topic-based quizzes**
- **Quiz answer review**
- **A personal learning library**
- **A guided lesson workflow**

## Repository Note

This repository is the continuation of the original LearnPilot project, previously developed and published under the `Im-orbitt` GitHub account.

The original repository is no longer actively maintained, and development has moved to this repository under the `itz-orbitt` GitHub account. The project history has been preserved.

## Features

### Smart Notes

Turn textbook content into detailed, topic-organized study notes designed for actual revision.

### AI Quizzes

Generate topic-based multiple-choice questions to test your understanding, with scoring and answer review.

### Guided Lessons

Work through each topic using a structured learning flow:

1. Review your notes
2. Test your understanding
3. Ask the AI Tutor

### AI Tutor

Ask questions about the selected learning material and receive explanations grounded in the topic being studied.

The Tutor uses the chapter content available to LearnPilot rather than acting as an unrestricted general-purpose chatbot.

### Personal Library

Keep uploaded chapters and generated learning material organized in your own library.

### Authentication

Create an account and securely access your own books and learning content.

### Progress Tracking

Progress tracking is planned for a future release.

### Free Plan

The Free plan currently supports up to **2 books per user**.

## How it works

1. **Create an account**
2. **Upload a PDF**

4. Generate chapter structure
5. Generate topic-based study notes

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **React Router**
- **Lucide React**
- **React Markdown**

### Backend

- **FastAPI**
- **Python**
- **PyMuPDF**
- **Google Gemini API**

### Data

- **Supabase**
- **PostgreSQL**

### Deployment

- **Vercel** — frontend hosting and production API proxy
- **Render** — FastAPI backend

## Architecture

LearnPilot uses a monorepo structure:

```text
learnpilot/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React + Vite frontend
│   └── api/          # FastAPI backend
├── docs/             # Project documentation
└── ...
```

The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend through the API layer.
In production, Vercel proxies `/api/*` requests to the Render backend. The backend handles authentication, PDF processing, AI generation, and database persistence.
